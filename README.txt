Mental Health can be scary when pushed into crisis. From personal experience, we thought the most important things to cover creating a mental health app would be keeping your support system close and developing healthy coping mechanisms.

In crisis, you don't want to be bogged down by frills so our streamlined "example" profile app is exactly what could put you in contact with your doctor, a close friend or survival strategies as soon as possible. Our color schemes were derived from researching the specific mental health issues people struggle with and using opposite color patterns to combat said negative states. This app has huge potential for growth by making the "Advice" sections interactive with music and timers, and making your profile customizable.

Keep your family and friends close, don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it and keep pushing on. We'll make it through this together.
